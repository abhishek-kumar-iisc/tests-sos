** About

This package contains the Sandia OpenSHMEM test suite and performance
test suite.  For the most recent versions of these tests or to propose
changes, please refer to the Sandia OpenSHMEM repository at
https://github.com/Sandia-OpenSHMEM/SOS.

** Building

The Sandia OpenSHMEM test suite utilizes the GNU Autotools build
system.  The standard GNU configure script and make system is used, as
follows:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ ../configure <options> CC=oshcc CXX=oshc++ FC=oshfort
  $ make
  $ make check

Several make variables can be used to modify the behvior of make check:

NPROCS
    Set the number of processes used to run each test.
    Example: "make check NPROCS=4"

TEST_RUNNER
    Specify the command used to run each test.  Example:
    "make check TEST_RUNNER='oshrun -np 2 -hosts compute1,compute2'"

TESTS
    Specify which tests to run.  For example, "make check TESTS="
    builds the tests without running them.
